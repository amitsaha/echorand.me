# About me

Hello, My name is Amit Saha. I work as a software engineer. I live in Sydney, Australia. 

You may be interested in learning more about [articles, books and other training material](../writings-trainings/),
I have created. I also try and share things I learn via [presenting](../talks/) at various conferences and meetups.

You may find something useful on my [GitHub](https://github.com/amitsaha) (a software repository host)
profile. 

# Open source contributions

Over the years, I have contributed code/docs to various projects:

- NetBeans IDE (Java)
- SymPy (Python)
- CPython (Python)
- NLog (C sharp)
- Statsd exporter (Go)
- Vector (Rust)
- Inspec (Ruby)

(My email address for these commits would be amitsaha.in@gmail.com or amitksaha@netbeans.org)

# This blog

This blog is generated using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and hosted on 
[GitHub pages](https://github.com/amitsaha/amitsaha.github.io) powered via [GitHub actions](https://github.com/amitsaha/echorand.me/blob/master/.github/workflows/main.yml). 

Basically the publishing flow for me looks like this:

1. I write my new content as a Markdown file and push a new commit with my changes
1. (1) triggers a build - a GitHub action action
1. A Docker image containing `hugo` is built using a custom [Dockerfile](https://github.com/amitsaha/echorand.me/blob/master/Dockerfile)
1. The image is then run to generate the website source
1. The generated website source is then pushed to [amitsaha.github.io](https://github.com/amitsaha/amitsaha.github.io)
