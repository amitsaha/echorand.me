# About me

Hello, My name is Amit - I work as a software engineer and I [explore software](https://github.com/amitsaha)
via programming, writing [articles](../articles) and [books](../books) and giving [talks](../talks).

These are a result of a lot of hit and trial and frustrating hours spent fighting with software only having 
the end result in mind. My approach to work has recently become - i struggle with everything, so I don't
need to pick and choose what kind of software I am working with - frontend, backend, infrastructure, windows
or Linux. Given a problem or an idea at hand, I will try to implement it without thinking I am better off 
doing something else. It's all a learning experience.

Feel free to reuse/relink any contents on this blog in anyway you please. I appreciate a credit linking back to
