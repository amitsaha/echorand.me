# About me

Hello, My name is Amit - I work in software.  A lot of what I explore makes it to my 
[articles](../articles), [books](../books), [talks](../talks) and [code](https://github.com/amitsaha). 
These are a result of a lot of hit and trial and frustrating hours spent fighting with software only having 
the end result in mind. My approach to work has recently become - i struggle with everything, so I don't
need to pick and choose what kind of software I am working with - frontend, backend, infrastructure, windows
or Linux. Given a problem or an idea at hand, I will try to implement it without thinking I am better off 
doing something else.
