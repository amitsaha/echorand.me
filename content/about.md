# About me

Hello, My name is Amit Saha. I work as a software engineer and I write books on computer programming. 

I live in Sydney, Australia. I would like to acknowledge the Gadigal of the Eora Nation, the traditional
custodians of this land and pay my respects to the Elders both past and present.

You may be interested in learning more about [articles, books and other training materials](../writings-trainings/)
I have authored. I also share things I learn via [presenting](../talks/) at various conferences and meetup groups.
I am not an expert on anything I write or share, so if you find a mistake/error in anything i share online,
please let me know.

You may find something useful on my [GitHub](https://github.com/amitsaha) (a software repository host)
profile.

# This blog

This blog is generated using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and hosted on 
[GitHub pages](https://github.com/amitsaha/amitsaha.github.io) powered via [GitHub actions](https://github.com/amitsaha/echorand.me/blob/master/.github/workflows/main.yml). 

The publishing flow for me looks like this:

1. I write my new content as a Markdown file and push a new commit with my changes
1. (1) triggers a build - a GitHub action action
1. A Docker image containing `hugo` is built using a custom [Dockerfile](https://github.com/amitsaha/echorand.me/blob/master/Dockerfile)
1. The image is then run to generate the website source
1. The generated website source is then pushed to [amitsaha.github.io](https://github.com/amitsaha/amitsaha.github.io)
