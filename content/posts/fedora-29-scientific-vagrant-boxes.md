[Fedora Scientific](https://labs.fedoraproject.org/en/scientific/) brings together the most useful open source scientific 
and numerical tools atop the goodness of the KDE desktop environment. From the beginning, our focus has been to provide 
scientists, engineers and programmers in numerical/scientific computing a Linux distribution which has most of the tools 
that they would need to use as part of their work. 

With the Fedora 29 release, we have also started to provide Vagrant boxes for Fedora Scientific to make it even 
easier to use Fedora Scientific while not doing away with your present operating system.  The complete instructions for 
setting up a vagrant box are available at the [download](https://labs.fedoraproject.org/scientific/download/index.html) page.

The Fedora Scientific Guide is available [here](https://fedora-scientific.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and gives you an overview
of the software included in the distribution.
