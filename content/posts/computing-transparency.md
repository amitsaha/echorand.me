One word that has always baffled me in the context of software/computing is “transparency”.  “This change is completely 
transparent to the application” - or some version of it is often used to tell consumers of an application/library that 
a certain change won’t be noticeable by the consumer at all. If I were to put in my English language hat on 
(a non-native at that), i would think that means “so, the consumer will see the change” and not the intended 
“the consumer will not see the change”.

The [wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_(human%E2%80%93computer_interaction)) on the topic Transparency (human–computer interaction) mentions this 
(towards the end of the first paragraph) which states my own sentiment well:

> The vast majority of the times, the term transparent is used in a misleading way to refer to the actual 
> invisibility of a computing process, which is also described by the term opaque, especially with regards
> to data structures.[citation needed] Because of this misleading and counter-intuitive definition, modern
> computer literature tends to prefer use of "agnostic" over "transparent".

So, i am going to start consciously using  “agnostic” from now on. At least, my mental model now is clear.
And I will know that i am not the only one confused by this.
