My article on getting started with gRPC in Python is up on the codeship blog:

- [Using gRPC in Python](https://blog.codeship.com/using-grpc-in-python/)

I build upon it in the next article:

- [Exploring Security, Metrics, and Error-handling with gRPC in Python](https://blog.codeship.com/exploring-security-metrics-and-error-handling-with-grpc-in-python/)


The demos can be found in the [python-grpc-demo](https://github.com/amitsaha/python-grpc-demo) repository.
