I had to rotate a few video frames using [iMovie](https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/imovie/id377298193?mt=8).
The instructions for rotating the frames were working, but the rotation was being applied to "neighboring" 
frames as well. It turns out the trick is to use "split clip" to split a frame so that you can isolate
the exact frame to be rotated. And that worked!

Thanks to this [forum reply](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/2466945).
