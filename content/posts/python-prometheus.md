I recently wrote two articles on Python application monitoring with Prometheus:

- [Monitoring Your Synchronous Python Web Applications Using Prometheus](https://blog.codeship.com/monitoring-your-synchronous-python-web-applications-using-prometheus/)
- [Monitoring Your Asynchronous Python Web Applications Using Prometheus](https://blog.codeship.com/monitoring-your-asynchronous-python-web-applications-using-prometheus/)

The demos can be found in the [python-prometheus-demo](https://github.com/amitsaha/python-prometheus-demo) repository.

Also checkout [aiohttp-prometheus](https://github.com/amitsaha/aiohttp-prometheus).
