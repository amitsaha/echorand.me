I love working in software. Mostly things work as expected, but at times no. I changed A,
how can Z be affected - after all they are all miles apart. Right? Wrong. Z can be
affected. Today's story is the latest - totally unexpected, but not surprising.

# Background

We run [ASP.NET compilation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/dotnet/articles/aa479044(v=msdn.10)) 
on our code base as part of every build in our Continuous Integration (CI)
pipeline. I changed some part of the pipeline so that we started caching `node_modules` directory
between different parts of a pipeline. So basically, .NET project `A` which did not have `node_modules`
directory when ASP.NET compilation was being run earlier now has a `node_modules` directory.

# Issue

The ASP.NET compilation was failing with an error:

```error ASPCONFIG: The CodeDom provider type "Microsoft.VisualC.CppCodeProvider, CppCodeProvider, 
Version=10.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b03f5f7f11d50a3a" could not be located.
```

Searching for it, I come across this [StackOverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20545224/the-codedom-provider-type-microsoft-visualc-cppcodeprovider-could-not-be-found).
The issue is that the ASP.NET compiler was trying to compile the JavaScript files as well.

# Solution

This is a hack, not a solution. I removed the `node_modules` directory before running the ASP.NET compilation.
