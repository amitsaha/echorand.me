Fedora 28 is [out](https://fedoramagazine.org/whats-new-fedora-28-workstation/) and I am happy
to share that after a few releases of no [Fedora Scientific](https://labs.fedoraproject.org/en/scientific/), 
we are back. Thanks to all your emails and enquiring about whether Fedora Scientific is dead.

The [Fedora Scientific Guide](http://fedora-scientific.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) has been updated a bit as well.

Thanks to all the packagers who fixed the issues we were having with some of the relevant packages.
