In a couple of days, on Saturday, I will be delivering my PYCON US talk titled [Counter, Gauge, Upper 90 - Oh my!](https://us.pycon.org/2018/schedule/presentation/133/). 

This talk covers my journey into application monitoring in general and Python applications specifically.
We will start with looking into the why of monitoring, learn the absolute basics of various monitoring
terminologies and use [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) to play with some of the aggregation and summarizing operation usually
associated with monitoring. We will look into what we should monitor and then conclude with a
look at integrating monitoring into our Python applications.

If you are keen to learn more before the talk to help you decide, my [article](https://opensource.com/article/18/4/metrics-monitoring-and-python) may be helpful.
