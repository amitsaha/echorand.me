My article "Write a program to tee output using Rust" is out in `Linux
Voice <https://linuxvoice.com>`__ (Issue 27).

When I first set out to learning Rust, I really liked how the Rust programming language book
took the approach of introducing the language via `small projects
<https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/guessing-game.html>`__. In a recent "New Rustacean" `bonus episode <http://www.newrustacean.com/show_notes/bonus/_4/index.html>`__, Chris
Krycho urges "to build anything" in Rust while one is learning the
language. If you like both of those things, I think you will find my
article useful. In it, I aim to introduce the reader to the Rust
programming language by building a program which mimics the
functionality of the `tee` program.

I have updated the `GitHub repo
<https://github.com/amitsaha/linux_voice_2>`__ with all the programs
discussed in the article.

I hope you enjoy reading the article, and please feel free to get in
touch if you have any suggestions/comments/queries. I am `@echorand`
