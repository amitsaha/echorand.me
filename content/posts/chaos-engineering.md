I have been exploring Chaos engineering as it applies to software systems this year.

As I explored further, I *really* got interested into it. 

Next, I point to various references that I have found useful so far.

## Theory

- [Principles of Chaos Engineering](https://principlesofchaos.org/) describes the fundamental principles of chaos 
engineering.
- [Chaos Engineering](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/chaos-engineering/9781492043850/) by Casey Rosenthal, Nora Jones

## Talks

[Identifyingn Hidden Dependencies](https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon20americas/presentation/fong-jones)

- Continuous verification
- Test your recover procedures
- Practice controlled experiments
