Fedora 22 was `released recently <http://fedoramagazine.org/fedora-22-released/>`__ which also means we
have a new Fedora Scientific release. `Fedora Scientific <https://labs.fedoraproject.org/en/scientific/>`__
is now part of `Fedora labs <http://fedoramagazine.org/new-websites-fedora-22/>`__.

As you can see, the new home for Fedora Scientific looks
amazing. The "Featured Applications" section features the most
important and useful tools in Fedora Scientific. I think that is a
great idea. Everyone associated with it, thank you very much.

I have also updated the `Fedora Scientific Guide
<http://fedora-scientific.readthedocs.org/>`__ to reflect the
changes.
