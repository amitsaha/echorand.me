Since around 1.5 years ago, I have been working in roles which has required to automate
various things usually classified as "infrastructure and operations" work. Sometimes
they have involved working with cloud infrastructure and at other times they have involved
interacting with databases and other services via HTTP APIs. During these period, to solve
such tasks I have started using the Go programming language to implement these things. 
I shared my experience and some examples in a talk at the combined Golang/Women who Go and Infrastructure
as code meetup in Sydney. The video starts from [here](https://youtu.be/5nqO_1yKhZE?t=383)
and the slides are [here](https://bit.ly/2mJCEnn). The slides have speaker notes which goes into
a bit of the background and how I came about adopting Golang.
